Send To Gist Visual Studio Extension V 1.0
------------------------------------------

A very simple Visual Studio Extension to paste code in Gist with only a right click.
Just select the code in the editor, right click and select "Send to Gist".
The code automatically is posted in the Gist service and the resulting URL is copied to the clipboard, ready to send it to someone else.
